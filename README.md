## ⚰️ Maple Union Tiler (NOV 2022 ~ MAR 2023)

This was the first project created in this repository before **MapleTool** were developed.

It was built only with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I decided to discontinue it, as it became too difficult to maintain.

After the **Nexon Open API** was released, I paused this project to rebuild it from scratch.
